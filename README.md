# IncidentExposed

IncidentExposed is a webapp that provides UMD students with an interactive map of all the UMPD logged daily crime and incident logs. It was built using BeautifulSoup, Folium, Pandas, and the Google Geocoding API.

This project won the Fidelity Investments-sponsored "Best Accessibility Hack" at the University of Maryland's biggest hackathon, Bitcamp. Here is the slidedeck that was presented to judges: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jNwyuzS566i14Crf8X7Y56Jr8X8MI4I2Bhk7C-8hIKk/edit?usp=sharing

We are currently working on providing safe route-finding and advanced analytics implementations for the web app. We are also exploring ways to prevent excessive API calls.
